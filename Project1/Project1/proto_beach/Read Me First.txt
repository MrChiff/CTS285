To run the file, I have it set up if you run in visual studio code, type

python run.py

It will then run the file in debugging mode.

I have created a user account called testuser
the password for the testuser account is password

We can log in, log out, look at user profile, change username, change first name and last name and change password as well as user profile picture.

If a user tries to do anything that only someone with an account can do it will tell you that you need to log in. 

I have started working on the answer checker game and have it where the user can input their numbers as well as operator, but I still need to figure out the back end code to the page and add the check button or cancel button.


The sign in page forgot password link currently doesn't work. I need to go in and set the page it will go to.

Memory bank and user statistics links currently do not work since I haven't created the pages for them yet.



Everything below is what will need to be imported through a virtual environment.
I am currently working on making the answer checker page but we can finally log in and play around with our account.
I have the run.py file set so all you have to do is run the run.py file and it will start the program up and run in debug mode.
The main file to run is the __init__.py file inside the app folder so it is pretty much app.py.
